I will bite my thumb at them;\\n    which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.\\n\\n    Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR\\n\\nABRAHAM\\n\\n    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\nSAMPSON\\n\\n    I do bite my thumb, sir.\\n\\nABRAHAM\\n\\n    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\\n\\nSAMPSON\\n\\n    [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say\\n    ay?\\n\\nGREGORY\\n\\n    No.\\n\\nSAMPSON\\n\\n    No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I\\n    bite my thumb, sir.\\n\\nGREGORY\\n\\n    Do you quarrel, sir?\\n\\nABRAHAM\\n\\n    Quarrel sir! no, sir.\\n\\nSAMPSON\\n\\n    If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.\\n\\nABRAHAM\\n\\n    No better.\\n\\nSAMPSON\\n\\n    Well, sir.\\n\\nGREGORY\\n\\n    Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.\\n\\nSAMPSON\\n\\n    Yes, better, sir.\\n\\nABRAHAM\\n\\n    You lie.\\n\\nSAMPSON\\n\\n    Draw, if you be men.

O, give me thy hand,\\n    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!\\n    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;\\n    A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,\\n    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\\n    This vault a feasting presence full of light.\\n    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.\\n\\n    Laying PARIS in the tomb\\n    How oft when men are at the point of death\\n    Have they been merry! which their keepers call\\n    A lightning before death: O, how may I\\n    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!\\n    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,\\n    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:\\n    Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet\\n    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\\n    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.\\n    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\\n    O, what more favour can I do to thee,\\n    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\\n    To sunder his that was thine enemy?\\n    Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,\\n    Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe\\n    That unsubstantial death is amorous,\\n    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps\\n    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?\\n    For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;\\n    And never from this palace of dim night\\n    Depart again: here, here will I remain\\n    With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here\\n    Will I set up my everlasting rest,\\n    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\\n    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\\n    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\\n    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\\n    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!\\n    Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!\\n    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on\\n    The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!\\n    Here's to my love!\\n\\n    Drinks\\n    O true apothecary!\\n    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.\\n\\n    Dies\\n\\n    Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade\\n\\nFRIAR LAURENCE\\n\\n    Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night\\n    Have my old feet stumbled at graves!

Tell me, good my friend,\\n    What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light\\n    To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,\\n    It burneth in the Capel's monument.\\n\\nBALTHASAR\\n\\n    It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,\\n    One that you love.\\n\\nFRIAR LAURENCE\\n\\n    Who is it?\\n\\nBALTHASAR\\n\\n    Romeo.\\n\\nFRIAR LAURENCE\\n\\n    How long hath he been there?\\n\\nBALTHASAR\\n\\n    Full half an hour.\\n\\nFRIAR LAURENCE\\n\\n    Go with me to the vault.\\n\\nBALTHASAR\\n\\n    I dare not, sir\\n    My master knows not but I am gone hence;\\n    And fearfully did menace me with death,\\n    If I did stay to look on his intents.\\n\\nFRIAR LAURENCE\\n\\n    Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:\\n    O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.\\n\\nBALTHASAR\\n\\n    As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,\\n    I dreamt my master and another fought,\\n    And that my master slew him.\\n\\nFRIAR LAURENCE\\n\\n    Romeo!\\n\\n    Advances\\n    Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains\\n    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?\\n    What mean these masterless and gory swords\\n    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?\\n\\n    Enters the tomb\\n    Romeo!

Then all alone\\n    At the prefixed hour of her waking,\\n    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;\\n    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,\\n    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:\\n    But when I came, some minute ere the time\\n    Of her awaking, here untimely lay\\n    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\\n    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,\\n    And bear this work of heaven with patience:\\n    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;\\n    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,\\n    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.\\n    All this I know; and to the marriage\\n    Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this\\n    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\\n    Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,\\n    Unto the rigour of severest law.\\n\\nPRINCE\\n\\n    We still have known thee for a holy man.\\n    Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?\\n\\nBALTHASAR\\n\\n    I brought my master news of Juliet's death;\\n    And then in post he came from Mantua\\n    To this same place, to this same monument.\\n    This letter he early bid me give his father,\\n    And threatened me with death, going in the vault,\\n    I departed not and left him there.\\n\\nPRINCE\\n\\n    Give me the letter; I will look on it.\\n    Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?\\n    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?\\n\\nPAGE\\n\\n    He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;\\n    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:\\n    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\\n    And by and by my master drew on him;\\n    And then I ran away to call the watch.\\n\\nPRINCE\\n\\n    This letter doth make good the friar's words,\\n    Their course of love, the tidings of her death:\\n    And here he writes that he did buy a poison\\n    Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal\\n    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\\n    Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!\\n    See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\\n    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.\\n    And I for winking at your discords too\\n    Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.\\n\\nCAPULET\\n\\n    O brother Montague, give me thy hand:\\n    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more\\n    Can I demand.\\n\\nMONTAGUE\\n\\n    But I can give thee more:\\n    For I will raise her statue in pure gold;\\n    That while Verona by that name is known,\\n    There shall no figure at such rate be set\\n    As that of true and faithful Juliet.\\n\\nCAPULET\\n\\n    As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;\\n    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!\\n\\nPRINCE\\n\\n    A glooming peace this morning with it brings;\\n    The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:\\n    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\\n    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:\\n    For never was a story of more woe\\n    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\\n\\n    Exeunt\""
